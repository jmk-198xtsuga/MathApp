# MathApp

## Introduction
MathApp is currently a hobbyist project I'm working on, trying to develop some Java code for interacting with some
of the mathematics I've worked with through the years.  At this point it is still very very much in its infancy,
and my current goal is developing a working structure for complex numbers and computations on them.  The higher
aspirations of having full Java generic support or type polymorphism is going to be the second phase after primitive
complex mathematical functions, because I am trying to avoid getting stuck on the fine details this early on.

Reuse of code is freely allowed for non-profit-generating pursuits with attribution, and to conserve future

Some future plans for project content include a representation of published work, which will be utilized under

labeled with attribution and the overall project license will be adapted in consideration of their requests.
(This is the motivation for the written permission for some uses.)

I make no guarantee of maintenance of any code for future API developments, bug fixes, performance issues, readability,
or any other inspiration for maintenance.

## Modifications of License Terms
If you seek any "upgrades" in allowed permissions or offer of maintenance, I am open to offers.  I will certainly
consider these if I can be financially stable doing so.
