        This isn\'t just a clever workaround, this actually leads to a mathematically correct
        framework where we can define numbers, operations, relationships, and all of the familiar
        mathematics, and methodically, repeatably arrive at the correct solutions to a diverse range
        of problems.  These solutions are even an essential "elementary" piece of most modern
        engineering, including electronics, physics, mechanical engineering, population modelling,
        and so forth.
